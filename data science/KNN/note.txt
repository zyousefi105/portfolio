knn
when use it?
its simple
needs scaling for sure
because give equal importance to all features even noises
what is important is number of neigbors which
can be found by examining in a for loop and plot accuracy diagram for neigbor ranges
or can be found with doing gridsearch
accuracy can be either of classidication accuracy

good sample of primary votes
good manipulation and joining strategies of 2,3 diffrent data frames to make a final clean useful data to apply ML techniques on

--------------------

when data is imbalanced for measuring accuracy (specially false positives) we'd better don't relay on 
confusion metrics but use roc_curve and this works best with threshhold probability based models like logistic regression.

So in logistic regression a good way to chosse the best threshhold is to draw threshhold via false negative diagrams to see
for what threshhold , false negative is the lowest.

so this is a good advanced point about logistic regression
