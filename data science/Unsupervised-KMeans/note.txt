clustering mrethods which are unsupervised categorical 
they are based on similarities

most popular : k-mean , that similarity here is distance
based on density of points in a cluster
simple but sensitive to scaling
needs to choose k (number of clusters at first)
its iterative multistep a;gorithm finally stops at a stopping creteria

the other model: DBSCAN
cluster can have any shape and size
no need to choose number of clusters in the biginning

not good for varying densities clusters
more difficult to tune

validation : silhouette_score
very sensitive to scaling

when do validation always check silhouette_score for different k(number of clusters) then choose the best
you might need to draw the diagram of k/silhouette_score to figure this out.

so first start with a default k to come to a model then start to tune it with actually changing the k.
