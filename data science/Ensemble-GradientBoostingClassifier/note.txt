
classifiers in skit-learn

Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
Decision Trees
Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression

choosing best model:

how to compare models using generic custom fit and predict functions that 
can accept different models, data and do the fit predict and scoring for us

tuning best model after choosing : with examining different parameters of that model using grid search

GradientBoostingClassifier and how to tune that - this is also a probability based model so goes well roc_curve - 
it is an ensemble method so even better than logistic regression - has better accuracy in general

make_scorer function that can make any type of scorer available in skit-learn

MLPClassifier from sklearn.neural_network 


Can we tune logistic regresion to get as good as gradientBoosting: Maybe how?
grid search with following params:
parameters = [{'C':[0.5,1.0,1.5,100]},{'penalty':['l2','l1']}]

how to tune gradientBoosting to make it possibly better:
parameters = [{'max_depth':[2,3,4]},{'n_estimators':[20,50,75,100,150]},{'learning_rate':[.02,.03,.05,.1,.15]}]
