Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Best-Guess Optimal Model (with combining gridsearch, cross validation ..)
cPickle - how to load an externalfigure

how to write our own custom functions like:
def accuracy_score
def preprocess_features - very important - generic
def performance_metric(y_true, y_predict) - for any metric
def fit_model(X, y) - very useful advanced approach to combine everything in one method which returns grid.best_estimator
