pca
mathematics behind
compare models with pca and without
why pca? remove noise columns and multi colliniarity

eigenvalues
eigenvectors

what is horn_parallel_analysis? an algorithm to plot a diagram againsy explained_varience diagram to determine which pca components 
are not noise and should be chosen, all point under horn_parallel_analysis diagrams are noise

do not forget to do standarize (normalize) data befor applying pca
