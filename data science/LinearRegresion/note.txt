linear regression 2 forms:
statsmodel
scitlearn

multicolloniarity
how to decrease that
colum selection feature - how? columns which have great correlation with the target but not with eachother

how to find correlation between columns
heatmap from sns

scrapping data
scaling data like using log function: (normalize data) 
to bring all columns to similar ranges 
to avoid the bigger ranges having more unaccurate effect on the result


normalized data is different than normallized distribution
